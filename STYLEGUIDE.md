<h2 id="accessibility">ACCESSIBILITY</h2>

### CONTRAST : :

The [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) specify the following contrast ratio requirements to ensure text readability:

> * **Normal Text:** A minimum contrast ratio of **4.5:1** between the text and its background.
> * **Large Text:** For text that is **18 point (24 pixels)** or larger, or **14 point (18.66 pixels)** and **bold**, a reduced minimum contrast ratio of **3:1** is acceptable.
> These guidelines are detailed in [Success Criterion 1.4.3: Contrast (Minimum)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/contrast-minimum.html).

For enhanced accessibility ([Level AAA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG2AAA-Conformance) compliance), WCAG recommends:

> * **Normal Text:** A contrast ratio of **7:1**
> * **Large Text:** A contrast ratio of **4.5:1**.

These enhanced contrast requirements are outlined in [Success Criterion **1.4.6:** Contrast (Enhanced)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/contrast-enhanced.html).

> By adhering to these contrast ratios, you can ensure that your content is accessible to individuals with visual impairments, including those with color vision deficiencies.
