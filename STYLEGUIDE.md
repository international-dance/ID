* **Normal Text:** A minimum contrast ratio of **4.5:1** between the text and its background.
* **Large Text:** For text that is **18 point (24 pixels)** or larger, or **14 point (18.66 pixels)** and **bold**, a reduced minimum contrast ratio of **3:1** is acceptable.

These guidelines are detailed in [Success Criterion 1.4.3: Contrast (Minimum)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/contrast-minimum.html).

For enhanced accessibility ([Level AAA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG2AAA-Conformance) compliance), WCAG recommends:

* **Normal Text:** A contrast ratio of **7:1**
* **Large Text:** A contrast ratio of **4.5:1**.

These enhanced contrast requirements are outlined in [Success Criterion **1.4.6:** Contrast (Enhanced)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/contrast-enhanced.html).

By adhering to these contrast ratios, you can ensure that your content is accessible to individuals with visual impairments, including those with color vision deficiencies.

Ensure sufficient contrast between text and background colors to meet  [**WCAG 2.1 AA**](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref/?versions=2.1) standards.

### Text Alternatives

Incorporating text alternatives for non-text content is essential for accessibility. According to the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/), specifically [Guideline 1.1: Text Alternatives](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/text-alternatives), all non-text content should have a text alternative that serves the equivalent purpose.

For detailed guidance on implementing text alternatives, refer to [Understanding Success Criterion 1.1.1: Non-text Content](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/non-text-content.html).
