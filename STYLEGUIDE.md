## 2. Color Palette

Primary colors: Black (#000000) and White (#FFFFFF) - two sharp extremes that symbolize discipline, class, and excellence - offset and balanced by soft and or muted pinks, reds, purples, and blues that symbolize grace, poise, and elegance. Together they symbolize a backdrop of excellence complimented with costumes of elegance.


The colors we have used between vary greatly and are subject to change. Ensure sufficient contrast between text and background colors to meet  [**WCAG 2.1 AA**](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref/?versions=2.1) standards (see [Accessibility](#accessibility) below).

<h2 id="accessibility">7. ACCESSIBILITY</h2>

### Contrast

The [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) specify the following contrast ratio requirements to ensure text readability:

* **Normal Text:** A minimum contrast ratio of **4.5:1** between the text and its background.
* **Large Text:** For text that is **18 point (24 pixels)** or larger, or **14 point (18.66 pixels)** and **bold**, a reduced minimum contrast ratio of **3:1** is acceptable.

These guidelines are detailed in [Success Criterion 1.4.3: Contrast (Minimum)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/contrast-minimum.html).

For enhanced accessibility ([Level AAA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG2AAA-Conformance) compliance), WCAG recommends:

* **Normal Text:** A contrast ratio of **7:1**
* **Large Text:** A contrast ratio of **4.5:1**.

These enhanced contrast requirements are outlined in [Success Criterion **1.4.6:** Contrast (Enhanced)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/contrast-enhanced.html).

By adhering to these contrast ratios, you can ensure that your content is accessible to individuals with visual impairments, including those with color vision deficiencies.

### Text Alternatives

Incorporating text alternatives for non-text content is essential for accessibility. According to the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/), specifically [Guideline 1.1: Text Alternatives](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/text-alternatives), all non-text content should have a text alternative that serves the equivalent purpose.

For detailed guidance on implementing text alternatives, refer to [Understanding Success Criterion 1.1.1: Non-text Content](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/non-text-content.html).

By adhering to these guidelines, "international.dance" ensures that its content is accessible to all users, including those utilizing screen readers.
